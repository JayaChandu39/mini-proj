        <b>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers</b>. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:<u> a paragraph is
        a group of at least five sentences,</u> a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and
        coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. <big>A paragraph is defined as “a group of
        sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116)</big>. Length and appearance do not
        determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.<mark> For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly
        journalistic styles,</mark> a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group
        of sentences that support one main idea.<i> In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,”
        because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph</i>.

       <strong> Despite the fact that piranhas are relatively harmless</strong>, many people continue to believe the pervasive myth that
        piranhas are dangerous to humans. <del>This impression of piranhas is exacerbated by their mischaracterization </del>
        popular media. For example,<small> the promotional poster for the 1978 horror film Piranha features an oversized
        piranha poised to bite the leg of an unsuspecting woman</small>. Such a terrifying representation easily captures the
        imagination and promotes unnecessary fear.<ins> While the trope of the man-eating piranhas lends excitement </ins> the
        adventure stories, it bears little resemblance to the real-life piranha. <em>By paying more attention to fact than
        fiction, humans may finally be able to let go of this inaccurate belief.</em>
